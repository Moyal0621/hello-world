# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Elan and I'm finally learning stuff about the coding world. I've been afraid to look at any of this for so long because I had already missed out on so many years that I could have been learning this crap so what was the point. Well here I am, humble and broken. I'm here to teach myself some shit.
